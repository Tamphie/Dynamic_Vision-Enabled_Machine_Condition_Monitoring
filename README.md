# Project Title
Dynamic Vision-Enabled Machine Condition Monitoring: A Point Cloud-Based Diagnostic Methodology
## Description
This article presents one of the pioneering attempts in the current literature on using a 3D point cloud data algorithm to process event data for machine fault diagnosis. A geometric data structure is proposed to represent event information and a deep learning method on point cloud data is employed for 
classification to perform diagnosis tasks. The article conducts experiments on diagnosing rotating machine faults using event-based cameras.
